# kernex.sbs

a small corner of the internet for side projects i genuinely enjoy building.  
minimal, experimental, and shipped for the love of it.

## about me

i’m [utkarsh](https://github.com/pro-utkarshM) — i build things close to the metal.  
kernels, systems, and side projects i care enough to ship.
